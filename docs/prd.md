## 1. Product Definition

### 1.1 Product Vision

Ghost Protocol is a Python-based, modular adversary-simulation training platform designed specifically for SOC/blue-team training and safe red-team exercises. The platform provides a comprehensive environment for security professionals to execute targeted attacks and emulate the post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors in a controlled setting.

### 1.2 Product Goals

1. **Create a modular framework** that accurately simulates adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to train blue teams in threat detection and response.
   
2. **Provide realistic attack chain simulation** from reconnaissance through lateral movement to exfiltration while maintaining complete control and auditability.
   
3. **Deliver measurable training outcomes** that improve SOC team capabilities and organizational security posture through repeatable, customizable adversary simulations.

### 1.3 User Stories

As a **Red Team Operator**, I want to create and execute complex attack chains using modular components so that I can realistically simulate adversary behaviors for training purposes.

As a **SOC Team Lead**, I want to design custom security scenarios that test my team's detection and response capabilities so that I can identify skill gaps and improve our defensive playbooks.

As a **Security Trainer**, I want to deploy pre-configured adversary simulations with clear learning objectives so that I can provide consistent, measurable training experiences.

As a **Blue Team Analyst**, I want to practice detecting and responding to realistic threats in a controlled environment so that I can improve my skills without risking production systems.

As a **Security Manager**, I want comprehensive reports on simulation exercises so that I can demonstrate ROI and justify security training investments.
